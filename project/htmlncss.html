               <h2>Html & CSS</h2>
               <p>On this page,I will be showing you how I create my very first Html website together with CSS.</p>

               <p>How do we start off to create html? Well, we can code then in several programs such as visual studios code, linux , notepad and  many more...</p>
               <p>I prefer using visual studios as it is easy to manage your code and visual studios code has many different type of programming language in there such as CSS which we are going to talk about it later. </p>
               <p>Head to google and type visual studio code. Click on download.It will bring you to this page.Download which program is your computer using.
                 For me, I using window 10, so click on window 10 and download.</p> 
               <img src="code.PNG" alt ="Download page for Visual stuido code" style = " width:500px;height:250px;">
               
               <p>Once finish downloading your visual studio code, launch it and you need to download respective program language in order to code.</p>
               
               <p>How did I learn how to code out in Html.It's by watching this youtuber called Jake Wright.Where in the video he explain and demonstrate about HTML which I find it easy to understand how it works.</p>
