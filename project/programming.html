              <p>What is Arduino Uno ?</p>
              <p>The Arduino Uno is an open-source microcontroller board based on the Microchip ATmega328P microcontroller and developed by Arduino.cc. The board is equipped with sets of digital and analog input/output pins that may be interfaced to various expansion boards and other circuits</p>
              <img src="ArduinoUno.png" alt ="ArduinoUno" style = " width:500px;height:250px;">

              <p>In order to program the Arduino Uno, We are require to download a Arduino IDE where we will be programming our input/output.</p>
              <img src="arduino.PNG" alt ="how Arduino IDE looks like when open up" style = " width:500px;height:250px;">
              <p>This is what it looks like when you open up your Arduino IDE.</p>
              <img src="arduino1.jpeg" alt ="Arduino IDE need to select the correct board for it to program" style = " width:500px;height:250px;">
              <p>For Arduino IDE, you are require to select the correct arduino board as it may not be able to program properly or cannot be read.</p>
              <p>For most the program for input/output, you can find it on examples or online.</p>

              <p>Lets say you do not have the physical components or you are scared to burn your electronic components or arduino uno.You can use this website called "tinkerCad".</p>
              <p>Tinkercad is a website which allows you to simulate the connection of your electronic components and testing your program as well. To see whether if every thing is running smoothly.</p>
              <img src="tinker.PNG" alt ="tinker allow you simulate your circuit whether it is working or not" style = " width:500px;height:250px;">
             
              <p>This connection was my past project which I did with Tinkercad</p>
              <img src="tinker1.PNG" alt ="Tinker also allows you to test your code if it's working." style = " width:500px;height:250px;">

              <p>This is where I simulate my code and test it whether it's running smoothly and according to what I want.</p>
