               <p>Fusion 360 is a CAD software platform for product design and manufacturing.It helps us to learn how to
                 design and manufacture a product which ensures aesthetics, form, fit and fuction.
               </p>
               <p>Here on this page,I going to show you what I have learned on fusion 360 which I did a exercise on making a knight chess piece.</p>
               <p>In order to get the design of the knight head.First,we have to find a image of the knight, save it and import to fusion 360.</p>
               <img src="knight.jpg" alt ="my knight image which I choose" style = " width:500px;height:250px;">
               <p>After importing the image inside fusion 360,begin by creating new sketch and trace the image</p>
               <p>This is how it will look like and also I added a construction line the middle of the knight.
                  It's because I am going to need it to revolve the base of the knight.
               </p>
               <img src="knight1.PNG" alt ="my knight image which I choose" style = " width:500px;height:250px;">
               <p>Once that done, I process to extrude the head of the knight to 5mm thickness,then I revolve the base and join them together</p>
               <p>This is how the final product of the knight chess piece look like.</p>
               <img src="knight2.PNG" alt ="my knight image which I choose" style = " width:500px;height:250px;">
