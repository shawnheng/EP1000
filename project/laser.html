              <p>In EP1000 module, We learn how to convert our 2d model drawing and send it to the laser cutter.To cut the parts we want  and assemble them together.</p>
              <p>In order for 2d model drawing send to the laser cutter to cut.We are require to do some changes in this software called CoralDraw.</p>
              <P>CoralDraw is software allow you change the hairline of your 2d model drawing to tell the laser cutter whether you want a cut, engrave or score.</P>
              <p>CoralDraw accepts files such as dxf, dwg , pdf and many more.</p>
              <p>I actually have some experience and knowleadge on how to use the laser cutter. With that, I show you a example of what I laser cut for my internship CDIO project.</p>

              <p>This is my casing which I design to hold my eletronic components in it for my project which it's called the interactive musical wall.</p>
              <p>This casing allows user to interactive and allowing them to change the tune, volume and instruments which they desire. </p>

              <p>I laser cut out on a 3mm plywood and assemble them together.</p>

              <p>This is how final assembling look like.</p>
