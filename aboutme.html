         <p>Hi,I am shawn.I am currently undergoing my final 3 year in Mechatronics and Robotics course in Singapore Polytechnic.The reason why I choose EP1000 because I heard you can learn 3d printing ,laser cutting and many more.This actually caught my attention as I am in my last year,So I decided that I should learn some new skills to update myself.</p>

           <h2>Hobbies & Interests </h2>
           <p>I like to draw and paint during free time to relax myself if I am feeling stress or bored.Recently, I have be learning how to do digital scuplture because I always wanted to learn how to scuplture for a long time  but I don't where to start until I met someone who does digital scuplture and I ask a lot of advice from him</p>
